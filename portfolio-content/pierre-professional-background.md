## The Career Transition (2024-2025)

### Why the Shift?

After 18 years of entrepreneurship, Pierre recognized that the emergence of generative AI created an opportunity to leverage his business experience in a new way. Rather than positioning as a pure technologist, he's building toward roles that bridge AI capabilities with business implementation.

### Current Focus

Pierre is rapidly upskilling in AI engineering while maintaining his business perspective:

- **Technical skills:** Python, RAG systems, knowledge graphs, workflow automation
- **AI infrastructure:** Building production systems that integrate multiple AI tools
- **Implementation focus:** Understanding why AI adoption fails in organizations and building solutions that actually get used

### What Makes Pierre Different

Most candidates for AI engineering roles come from pure technical backgrounds. Pierre offers:

1. **18 years of being in rooms where tools get rejected** - Understanding the human side of technology adoption
2. **Experience delivering under pressure** - One-shot installations teach you to front-load risk
3. **Full-stack business perspective** - Having worn every hat in a business
4. **Practical builder mindset** - Already shipping AI-powered tools, not just studying them

## Philosophy on AI Implementation

Pierre believes that AI adoption fails not because of technical limitations, but because of:

1. **Tools built without understanding the user's workflow**
2. **Lack of trust from non-technical stakeholders**
3. **Over-engineered solutions when simple would suffice**
4. **Poor change management and training**

His approach: Build AI solutions that meet people where they are, not where technologists think they should be.
